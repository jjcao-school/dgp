# Digital Geometry 2021 (DLUT)
## 0. Introduction

Digital geometry processing (DGP), a subfield of computer graphics will be introduced in this course. Recent innovation in 3D acquisition (3D scanning, realtime depth sensor) and 3D production (3D printing) technologies, has made DGP become one of the vital technologies in applications ranging from visual effects, interactive games, CAD, machine perception, robotics to other related fields. This course will introduct primary representations of geometry shapes and how to  analysis and process geometry shapes on these representations.
